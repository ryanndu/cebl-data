# cebl-data

Data repository for game data from the [Canadian Elite Basketball League](https://www.cebl.ca) (CEBL). GitHub Actions are scheduled to run daily and update data throughout the season.

## Usage

This data can be accessed in two ways:

-  You can manually download the `.csv` files via the release pages
-  You can use the functions from the [`ceblR`](https://awosoga.github.io/ceblR/)/[`ceblpy`](https://ryanndu.github.io/ceblpy/) packages to load the data as data frames.
